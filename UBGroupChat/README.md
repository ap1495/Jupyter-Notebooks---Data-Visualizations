Data visualization of a Whatsapp group chat using plotly for python.

This notebook contains interactive plotly visualizations which can accessed using this nbviewer link - https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ap1495/Jupyter-Notebooks---Data-Visualizations/blob/master/UBGroupChat/UB-MIS-GroupChat.ipynb or by clicking on this '⊖' in the top right corner of the notebook file. 

There is also an additional HTML file where you can view the interactive plotly visualizations, but it is too big to be viewed on GitHub.
